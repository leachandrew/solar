Each year, Canada and all other signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change submit [annual National Inventory Reports (NIRs)](https://unfccc.int/ghg-inventories-annex-i-parties/2021) which track annual GHG emissions within their countries.

These graphs utilize [Canada's emissions inventory](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/inventory.html), combined with [emissions projections](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-emissions/projections.html) from Environment and Climate Change Canada, to help frame both our emissions past and future.
